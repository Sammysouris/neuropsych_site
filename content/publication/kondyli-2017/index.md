abstract: 'Background: The cerebral lateralization of language has attracted great
  research interest. Nevertheless, the bulk of the work focuses on language production
  and comprehension; research on cerebral lateralization during writing is limited.
  Material/ Methods: The present study assessed cerebral lateralization in 60 participants
  (mean age = 26.65 years, SD = 6.05, range = 20-44), 30 right-handers (14 men) and
  30 left-handers (16 men), during written language production by means of functional
  transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTCD) for the first time. Results: Findings
  show that left-hemispheric lateralization is observed during silent word production,
  for both left- and right-handers. However, during written word production, the degree
  of typical (left) hemispheric lateralization was significantly increased for right-handers,
  while left-handers presented atypical (right) hemispheric lateralization. Importantly,
  the difference between silent and written word generation was significantly higher
  in left- compared to right-handers. No main effect of sex or interactions with sex
  were observed. Conclusions: Findings suggest that a wider network of right-hemispheric
  areas is used during writing in left-handers. Thus, the known differen - ces in
  cerebral lateralization between right- and left-handers are stron ger during written
  language production. However, the rela - tive contribution of language and motor
  areas needs to be further elucidated.'
