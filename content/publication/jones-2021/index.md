abstract: "Abstract: Over the past 10 years, Oosterhof and Todorov's valence窶電ominance\
  \ model has emerged as the most prominent account of how people evaluate faces on\
  \ social dimensions. In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin\
  \ social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and\
  \ tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other\
  \ regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov's methodology\
  \ across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof\
  \ and Todorov's original analysis strategy, the valence窶電ominance model generalized\
  \ across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated\
  \ dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results\
  \ suggest that, while the valence窶電ominance model generalizes very well across regions\
  \ when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed\
  \ when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension\
  \ reduction solution. Protocol registration: The stage 1 protocol for this Registered\
  \ Report was accepted in principle on 5 November 2018. The protocol, as accepted\
  \ by the journal, can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7611443.v1."
