abstract: 'Background: Dealing with psychological and study skill difficulties can
  present a challenge for both Higher Education (HE) students, who suffer from them,
  but also for HE Institutions and their support services. Alternative means of support,
  such as online interventions, have been identified as cost-effective and efficient
  ways to provide inclusive support to HE students, removing many of the barriers
  to help-seeking as well as promoting mental health and wellbeing. Case presentation:
  The current case study initially outlines the rigorous approach in the development
  of one such online intervention system, MePlusMe. It further highlights key features
  that constitute innovative delivery of evidence-based psychological and educational
  practice in the areas of mental health, promotion of wellbeing, support of mood
  and everyday functioning, and study-skills enhancement. Conclusions: This case study
  aims to present the innovative features of MePlusMe in relation to current needs
  and evidence-basis. Finally, it presents future directions in the evaluation, assessment,
  and evidence of the fitness-for-purpose process.'
