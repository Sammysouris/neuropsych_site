abstract: Although very often teachers show a great interest in introducing findings
  from the field of neuroscience in their classrooms, there is growing concern about
  the lack of academic instruction on neuroscience on teachers' curricula because
  this has led to a proliferation of neuromyths. We surveyed 479 undergraduate (mean
  age = 19.60 years, SD = 2.29) and 94 postgraduate students (mean age = 28.52 years,
  SD = 7.16) enrolled in Departments of Education at the University of Thessaly and
  the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. We used a 70-item questionnaire
  aiming to explore general knowledge on the brain, neuromyths, the participants'
  attitude toward neuroeducation as well as their reading habits. Prospective teachers
  were found to believe that neuroscience knowledge is useful for teachers (90.3%
  agreement), to be somewhat knowledgeable when it comes to the brain (47.33% of the
  assertions were answered correctly), but to be less well informed when it comes
  to neuroscientific issues related to special education (36.86% correct responses).
  Findings further indicate that general knowledge about the brain was found to be
  the best safeguard against believing in neuromyths. Based on our results we suggest
  that prospective teachers can benefit from academic instruction on neuroscience.
  We propose that such instruction takes place in undergraduate courses of Departments
  of Education and that emphasis is given in debunking neuromyths, enhancing critical
  reading skills, and dealing with topics relevant to special education.
