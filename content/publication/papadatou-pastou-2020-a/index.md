abstract: Although learning styles (LS) have been recognised as a neuromyth, they
  remain a virtual truism within education. A point of concern is that the term LS
  has been used within theories that describe them using completely different notions
  and categorisations. This is the first empirical study to investigate education
  professionals' conceptualisation, as well as means of identifying and implementing
  LS in their classroom. A sample of 123 education professionals were administered
  a questionnaire consisting both closed- and open-ended questions. Responses were
  analysed using thematic analysis. LS were found to be mainly conceptualised within
  the Visual-Auditory-(Reading)-Kinaesthetic (VAK/VARK) framework, as well as Gardner's
  multiple intelligences. Moreover, a lot of education professionals confused theories
  of learning (e.g., behavioural or cognitive theories) with LS. In terms of identifying
  LS, educators reported using a variety of methods, spanning from observation and
  everyday contact to the use of tests. The ways LS were implemented in the classroom
  were numerous, comprising various teaching aids, participatory techniques and motor
  activities. Overall, we argue that the extended use of the term LS gives the illusion
  of a consensus amongst educators, when a closer examination reveals that the term
  LS is conceptualised, identified and implemented idiosyncratically by different
  individuals. This study aims to be of use to pre-service and in-service teacher
  educators in their effort to debunk the neuromyth of LS and replace it with evidence-based
  practices.
