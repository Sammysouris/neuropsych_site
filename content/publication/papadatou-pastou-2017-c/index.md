abstract: 'Background: Recent evidence suggests that there is an increasing need for
  accessible and anonymous services to support higher education (HE) students suffering
  from psychological and/or academic difficulties. Such difficulties can lead to several
  negative outcomes, including poor academic performance, sub-optimal mental health,
  reduced study satisfaction, and dropout from study. Currently, universities in the
  UK lack financial resources and the on-campus mental health services traditionally
  offered to students are increasingly economically unsustainable. Compounded by the
  perceived stigma of using such services, mental health providers have been driven
  to address the escalating needs of students through online services. Methods: In
  this paper, we review online support systems identified through a literature search
  and a manual search of references in the identified papers. Further systems were
  identified through web searches, and systems still in development were identified
  by consultation with researchers in the field. We accessed systems online to extract
  relevant information, regarding the main difficulties addressed by the systems,
  the psychological techniques used and any relevant research evidence to support
  their effectiveness. Conclusion: A large number of web-based support systems have
  been developed to support mental health and wellbeing, although few specifically
  target HE students. Further research is necessary to establish the effectiveness
  of such interventions in providing a cost-effective alternative to face-to-face
  therapy, particularly in certain settings such as HE institutions.'
