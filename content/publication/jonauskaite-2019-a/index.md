abstract: Across cultures, people associate colours with emotions. Here, we test the
  hypothesis that one driver of this cross-modal correspondence is the physical environment
  we live in. We focus on a prime example – the association of yellow with joy, –
  which conceivably arises because yellow is reminiscent of life-sustaining sunshine
  and pleasant weather. If so, this association should be especially strong in countries
  where sunny weather is a rare occurrence. We analysed yellow-joy associations of
  6625 participants from 55 countries to investigate how yellow-joy associations varied
  geographically, climatologically, and seasonally. We assessed the distance to the
  equator, sunshine, precipitation, and daytime hours. Consistent with our hypotheses,
  participants who live further away from the equator and in rainier countries are
  more likely to associate yellow with joy. We did not find associations with seasonal
  variations. Our findings support a role for the physical environment in shaping
  the affective meaning of colour.
