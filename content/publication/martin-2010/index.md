abstract: In response to the comment by Vuoksimaa and Kaprio (2010) on our previous
  article on sex differences in left-handedness (Papadatou-Pastou, Martin, Munafò,
  and Jones, 2008), we carried out an additional meta-analysis to explore whether
  the widely observed tendency for rates of left-handedness to be greater among male
  than female individuals is also found in Scandinavian (Nordic) studies. The overall
  male-to-female ratio for left- to right-handedness odds provides evidence in favor
  of this hypothesis. However, the results were subject to a significant moderating
  effect related to nation of origin. We discuss the potential impact on observed
  measures of additive rather than multiplicative processes that may underlie sex
  differences in handedness and also the date-of-study effect on handedness rates.
