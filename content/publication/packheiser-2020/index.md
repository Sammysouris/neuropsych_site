abstract: Human lateral preferences, such as handedness and footedness, have interested
  researchers for decades due to their pronounced asymmetries atÂ the population level.
  While there are good estimates on the prevalence of handedness in the population,
  there is no large-scale estimation on the prevalence of footedness. Furthermore,
  the relationship between footedness and handedness still remains elusive. Here,
  we conducted meta-analyses with four different classification systems for footedness
  on 145,135 individuals across 164 studies including new data from the ALSPAC cohort.
  The study aimed to determine a reliable point estimate of footedness, to study the
  association between footedness and handedness, and to investigate moderating factors
  influencing footedness. We showed that the prevalence of atypical footedness ranges
  between 12.10% using the most conservative criterion of left-footedness to 23.7%
  including all left- and mixed-footers as a single non-right category. As many as
  60.1% of left-handers were left-footed whereas only 3.2% of right-handers were left-footed.
  Males were 4.1% more often non-right-footed compared to females. Individuals with
  psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited a higher prevalence of non-right-footedness.
  Furthermore, the presence of mixed-footedness was higher in children compared to
  adults and left-footedness was increased in athletes compared to the general population.
  Finally, we showed that footedness is only marginally influenced by cultural and
  social factors, which play a crucial role in the determination of handedness. Overall,
  this study provides new and useful reference data for laterality research. Furthermore,
  the data suggest that footedness is a valuable phenotype for the study of lateral
  motor biases, its underlying genetics and neurodevelopment.
