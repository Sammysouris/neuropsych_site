abstract: 'Objective: Increased rates of atypical handedness are observed in groups
  of neurotypical individuals who are low-performing in mathematical tasks as well
  as in individuals with special educational needs, such as dyslexia and autism. This
  is the first series of studies and meta-analyses to investigate whether elevated
  levels of atypical handedness are also to be found in individuals with Mathematical
  Learning Difficulties (MLD). Method: We report three new studies (N= 134; N= 1,899;
  N= 149) and two sets of meta-analyses (22 studies; N= 3,649) on the handedness rates
  of MLD and Typically Achieving (TA) individuals. Results: No evidence of a difference
  in atypical handedness was found when the direction of hand preference was used
  as the handedness measure, with the exception of weak evidence when writing hand
  was used as the handedness criterion. When combining data meta-analytically no hand
  preference differences between the MLD and TA were detected. Conclusions: There
  is very limited evidence for elevated levels of atypical hand preference in MLD.
  We suggest that:(i) potential handedness effects are subtle and require larger samples,(ii)
  direction of hand preference is not a sensitive enough measure of handedness, or
  that (iii) increased rates of atypical hand preference are related specifically
  to conditions that present with language difficulties, as handedness is a behavioral
  index for language lateralization, and not to conditions requiring special educational
  needs at large. Future studies need to investigate the possible relationship of
  hand skill and of degree of hand preference with MLD.'
