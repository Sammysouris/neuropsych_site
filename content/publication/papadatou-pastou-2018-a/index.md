abstract: Learning styles (LS) have dominated educational practice since their popularization
  in the 1970s. Studies have shown that they are accepted by more than 90% of teachers
  worldwide. However, LS have also received extensive criticism from researchers and
  academics, due to the poor theoretical justification of the theory, their problematic
  measurement, and the lack of systematic studies supporting them. The present study
  tested the hypothesis that teachers' and students' assessment of preferred LS should
  correspond. Moreover, it tested whether teachers' judgment of LS is driven by the
  students' IQ. Both questions were studied for the first time in a systematic fashion
  within LS research in primary school pupils. Fifth and sixth grade pupils (n = 199)
  were asked to self-assess their preferred LS, while their teachers were asked to
  provide their own assessment on individual pupils' LS. No relationship was found
  between pupils' self-assessment and teachers' assessment, suggesting that teachers
  cannot assess the LS of their students accurately. Moreover, students' intelligence
  was not found to drive teachers' assessment of their LS. This study adds to the
  body of evidence that is skeptical of the adoption of LS in mainstream education.
