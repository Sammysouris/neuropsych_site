abstract: The adequacy of three competing theories of hormonal effects on cerebral
  laterality are compared using functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD).
  Thirty-three adult males participated in the study (21 left-handers). Cerebral lateralization
  was measured by fTCD using an extensively validated word generation task. Adult
  salivary testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) concentrations were measured by luminescence
  immunoassay and prenatal T exposure was indirectly estimated by the somatic marker
  of 2nd to 4th digit length ratio (2D:4D). A significant quadratic relationship between
  degree of cerebral laterality for language and adult T concentrations was observed,
  with enhanced T levels for strong left hemisphere dominance and strong right hemisphere
  dominance. No systematic effects on laterality were found for cortisol or 2D:4D.
  Findings suggest that higher levels of T are associated with a relatively attenuated
  degree of interhemispheric sharing of linguistic information, providing support
  for the callosal and the sexual differentiation hypotheses rather than the Geschwind,
  Behan and Galaburda (GBG) hypothesis.
