abstract: The link between colour and emotion and its possible similarity across cultures
  are questions that have not been fully resolved. Online, 711 participants from China,
  Germany, Greece and the UK associated 12 colour terms with 20 discrete emotion terms
  in their native languages. We propose a machine learning approach to quantify (a)
  the consistency and specificity of colour–emotion associations and (b) the degree
  to which they are country-specific, on the basis of the accuracy of a statistical
  classifier in (a) decoding the colour term evaluated on a given trial from the 20
  ratings of colour–emotion associations and (b) predicting the country of origin
  from the 240 individual colour–emotion associations, respectively. The classifier
  accuracies were significantly above chance level, demonstrating that emotion associations
  are to some extent colour-specific and that colour–emotion associations are to some
  extent country-specific. A second measure of country-specificity, the in-group advantage
  of the colour-decoding accuracy, was detectable but relatively small (6.1%), indicating
  that colour–emotion associations are both universal and culture-specific. Our results
  show that machine learning is a promising tool when analysing complex datasets from
  emotion research.
