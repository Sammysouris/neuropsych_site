abstract: The main paradigm in the study of negotiation is the decision-making approach,
  which emphasizes an individual-based factor of behavior, self-interest. Focusing
  on the ultimatum game, we reviewed the segment of the empirical literature that
  emphasizes social-contextual mechanisms, particularly interpersonal communication
  and intergroup relations. We found that, through communication, proposals are treated
  as justifiable claims and that the social context provides different norms for justification.
  We suggest that aspects of communicative rationality, such as normative rightness
  and subjective truthfulness, act as organizing principles for approaching negotiation
  as a joint rule-making process. We argue that any rule proposed is only validated
  through the agreement of the other side(s) and, thus, the consensualistic approach
  is better suited for the analysis of negotiation compared to the existing decision-making
  paradigm.
