abstract: Drugs which inhibit the re-uptake of monoamines in the brain are effective
  in the treatment of depression; however, the neuropsychological mechanisms which
  lead to the resolution of depressive symptomatology are unclear. Behavioral studies
  in healthy volunteers suggest that acute administration of the selective norepinephrine
  reuptake inhibitor reboxetine modulates emotional processing. The current study
  therefore explored the neural basis of this effect. A single dose of reboxetine
  (4 mg) or placebo was administered to 24 healthy volunteers in a double-blind between-group
  design. Neural responses during categorisation and recognition of self-referent
  personality trait words were assessed using event-related functional Magnetic Resonance
  Imaging (fMRI). Reboxetine had no effect on neuronal response during self-referent
  categorisation of positive or negative personality trait words. However, in a subsequent
  memory test, reboxetine reduced neuronal activation in a fronto-parietal network
  during correct recognition of positive target words vs. matched distractors. This
  was combined with increased speed to recognize positive vs. negative words compared
  to control subjects and suggests facilitated memory for positive self-referent material.
  These results support the hypothesis that antidepressants have early effects on
  the neural processing of emotional material which may be important in their therapeutic
  actions. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
