abstract: The literature on the relationship between handedness and cognitive ability
  is riddled with studies using different conceptualizations of handedness (e.g.,
  hand preference vs hand skill, direction vs degree, consistency vs inconsistency)
  and different conceptualizations of cognitive ability (intelligence vs distinct
  abilities), as well as different measurements thereof. Recently the literature was
  summarized by means of meta-analytic techniques. The findings show quite robustly
  that when handedness is assessed as hand preference and individuals are classified
  according to direction (i.e., as left-handers vs right-handers), no differences
  in cognitive ability emerge between handedness groups. However, other evidence points
  to the importance of assessing degree rather than direction of handedness and of
  employing hand skill rather than hand preference measures. A meta-analysis of such
  studies has not been possible to date, due to their scarcity. It is here suggested
  that degree of handedness and hand skill measures are employed in future studies
  exploring the possible relationship between handedness and cognitive ability so
  as to elaborate whether or not such a relationship exists and if so, what its characteristics
  are.
