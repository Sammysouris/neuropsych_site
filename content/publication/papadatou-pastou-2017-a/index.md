abstract: 'Behavioural and cerebral lateralization are thought to be controlled, at
  least in part, by prenatal testosterone (T) levels, explaining why sex differences
  are found in both laterality traits. The present study investigated hormonal effects
  on laterality using adult salivary T levels, to explore the adequacy of competing
  theories: the Geschwind, Behan and Galaburda, the callosal, and the sexual differentiation
  hypotheses. Sixty participants (15 right-handers and 15 left-handers of each sex)
  participated. Behavioural lateralization was studied by means of hand preference
  tests (i.e., the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory and the Quantification of Hand Preference
  test) and a hand skill test (i.e., the Peg-Moving test) whereas cerebral lateralization
  for language was studied using the Consonant-Vowel Dichotic Listening test and the
  Visual Half-Field Lexical Decision test. Salivary T and cortisol (C) concentrations
  were measured by luminescence immunoassay. Canonical correlations did not reveal
  significant relationships between T levels and measures of hand preference, hand
  skill, or language laterality. Thus, our findings add to the growing literature
  showing no relationship between T concentrations with behavioural or cerebral lateralization.
  It is claimed that prenatal T is not a major determinant of individual variability
  in either behavioural or cerebral lateralization.'
