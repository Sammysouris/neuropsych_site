abstract: The causes of developmental stuttering, a neurodevelopmental communicative
  disorder, have not been elucidated to date. Neuroimaging studies suggest that atypical
  cerebral laterality could be one of such causal factors. Moreover, handedness, a
  behavioural index for cerebral laterality, has been linked to stuttering and recovery
  from it. However, findings are conflicting, possibly due to sample selection procedures,
  which typically rely on self-reported stuttering, and to the fact that handedness
  is typically assessed with regards to its direction rather than degree. We investigated
  the possible relationship between handedness and stuttering. This is the first study
  where children who stutter (CWS) were selected using clinical criteria as well as
  speech samples and where a non-Western population was studied. Findings from 83
  CWS aged 3–9 years (mean = 6.43, SD = 1.84) and 90 age- and sex-matched children
  who do not stutter (mean = 6.45, SD = 1.71) revealed no differences in their hand
  preference scores as evaluated by parent-completed Edinburgh Handedness Inventory,
  for both direction and degree. The severity of stuttering was not found to correlate
  with the degree of handedness. We suggest that parents and professionals not treat
  left- or mixed-hand preference as a reason for concern with regards to stuttering.
