abstract: "An elevated prevalence of atypical handedness (left-, mixed-, or non-right-handedness)\
  \ has been repeatedly reported in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\
  \ compared to typically developing individuals. However, the exact magnitude of\
  \ this difference as well as the presence of possible moderating factors remains\
  \ unknown. Here, we present three sets of meta-analyses of studies that assessed\
  \ the handedness prevalence among individuals with ASD, totaling 1199 individuals\
  \ (n = 723 individuals with ASD and n = 476 typically developing individuals). Meta-analysis\
  \ set 1 found that individuals with ASD are 3.48, 2.49, and 2.34 times more likely\
  \ to be non-right-handed, left-handed, and mixed-handed compared to typically developing\
  \ individuals, respectively. Meta-analysis set 2 found a 45.4%, 18.3%, and 36.1%\
  \ prevalence of non-right-handedness, left-handedness, and mixed-handedness, respectively,\
  \ amongst individuals with ASD. The \uFEFFclassification of handedness, the instrument\
  \ used to measure handedness, and the main purpose of the study were found to moderate\
  \ the findings of meta-analysis set 2. Meta-analysis set 3 revealed a trend towards\
  \ weaker handedness for individuals with ASD. The elevated levels of atypical handedness\
  \ in individuals with ASD could be attributed to atypicalities in cerebral structure\
  \ and lateralization for language in individuals with ASD."
