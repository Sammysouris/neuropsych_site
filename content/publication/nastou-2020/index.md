abstract: Meta-analyses have shown that several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
  disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, are associated with
  a higher prevalence of left-and/or mixed-handedness. One neurodevelopmental disorder
  for which this association is unclear is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
  (ADHD). Here, some empirical studies have found evidence for a higher prevalence
  of left-and/or mixed-handedness in individuals with ADHD compared to neurotypical
  individuals. However, other studies failed to establish such an association. Therefore,
  meta-analytic integration is critical to estimate whether or not there is an association
  between handedness and ADHD. We report the results of three meta-analyses comparing
  handedness in individuals with ADHD to controls (typically developing individuals).
  The results show no evidence of differences in left-handedness and non-right-handedness
  between individuals with ADHD and controls. It was, however, found that individuals
  with ADHD showed a higher prevalence of mixed-handedness than controls. These findings
  are discussed in the context of the hypothesis that ADHD is a disorder in which
  mostly right-hemispheric brain networks are affected. Since right-handedness represents
  a dominance of the left motor cortex for fine motor behavior, such as writing, as
  well as a left-hemispheric dominance for language functions, and about 90% of individuals
  are right-handers, this hypothesis might explain why left-handedness is mostly unaffected
  in ADHD. We suggest that only in conditions where language is affected one should
  expect to find elevated levels of left Å‚dots
