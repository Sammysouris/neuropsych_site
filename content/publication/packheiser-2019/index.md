abstract: The earliest form of social contact for a newborn is being cradled by its
  mother. This important behavior has been found to be lateralized to the left side
  by many, but not all empirical studies. Factors that have been suggested to modulate
  cradling asymmetry are handedness and sex. However, these factors have not been
  demonstrated consistently, possibly due to low sample sizes and inconsistent experimental
  paradigms. To address this issue, we used a meta-analytical approach to (1) quantify
  the widely reported leftward bias in human cradling and (2) identify moderating
  factors of the cradling bias such as handedness and sex. Across forty studies, we
  observed a leftward cradling bias showing that this effect is robust and replicable.
  Furthermore, we found that left-handers demonstrate a significantly less pronounced
  leftward bias compared to right-handers and that males are less lateralized compared
  to females. In conclusion, we could verify that parental handedness and sex contribute
  to a cradling population bias. Future studies examining genetic factors could illuminate
  the mechanism supporting a cradling bias.
