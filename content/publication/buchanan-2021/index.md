abstract: <p>As researchers embrace open and transparent data sharing, they will need
  to provide information about their data that effectively helps others understand
  their data sets' contents. Without proper documentation, data stored in online repositories
  such as OSF will often be rendered unfindable and unreadable by other researchers
  and indexing search engines. Data dictionaries and codebooks provide a wealth of
  information about variables, data collection, and other important facets of a data
  set. This information, called metadata, provides key insights into how the data
  might be further used in research and facilitates search-engine indexing to reach
  a broader audience of interested parties. This Tutorial first explains terminology
  and standards relevant to data dictionaries and codebooks. Accompanying information
  on OSF presents a guided workflow of the entire process from source data (e.g.,
  survey answers on Qualtrics) to an openly shared data set accompanied by a data
  dictionary or codebook that follows an agreed-upon standard. Finally, we discuss
  freely available Web applications to assist this process of ensuring that psychology
  data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.</p>
