abstract: An under-investigated aspect of handedness, a biological proxy for cerebral
  laterality for language, is its prevalence amongst deaf individuals. We present
  four sets of meta-analyses on studies measuring handedness prevalence in deaf individuals,
  comprising 31 data sets and totaling 5,392 participants (4,606 deaf, 786 hearing).
  Deaf individuals were found to be 2.61 times more likely to be non-right-handed
  and 2.25 times more likely to be left-handed compared to their hearing counterparts.
  When handedness was measured by means of manipulative actions, the weighted estimates
  of handedness prevalence for deaf populations were 17.70% and 14.70% for non-right-
  and left-handedness respectively; when handedness was measured by means of sign
  actions, the prevalence was 10.60% and 9.70%, respectively. Yet, when comparing
  studies that measured handedness in the same deaf individuals using both manipulative
  and sign actions, no difference was found in their handedness prevalence. This pattern
  is taken to suggest that the higher prevalence of atypical handedness in the deaf
  population may be linked to delayed language acquisition.
