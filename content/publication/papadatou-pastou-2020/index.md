abstract: Across time and place, right hand preference has been the norm, but what
  is the precise prevalence of leftand right-handedness? Frequency of left-handedness
  has shaped and underpinned different fields of research, from cognitive neuroscience
  to human evolution, but reliable distributional estimates are still lacking. While
  hundreds of empirical studies have assessed handedness, a large-scale, comprehensive
  review of the prevalence of handedness and the factors that moderate it, is currently
  missing. Here, we report 5 meta-analyses on hand preference for different manual
  tasks and show that left-handedness prevalence lies between 9.3% (using the most
  stringent criterion of left-handedness) to 18.1% (using the most lenient criterion
  of nonright-handedness), with the best overall estimate being 10.6% (10.4% when
  excluding studies assessing elite athletes' handedness). Handedness variability
  depends on (a) study characteristics, namely year of publication and ways to measure
  and classify handedness, and (b) participant characteristics, namely sex and ancestry.
  Our analysis identifies the role of moderators that require taking into account
  in future studies on handedness and hemispheric asymmetries. We argue that the same
  evolutionary mechanisms should apply across geographical regions to maintain the
  roughly 1:10 ratio, while cultural factors, such as pressure against left-hand use,
  moderate the magnitude of the prevalence of left-handedness. Although handedness
  appears as a straightforward trait, there is no universal agreement on how to assess
  it. Therefore, we urge researchers to fully report study and participant characteristics
  as well as the detailed procedure by which handedness was assessed and make raw
  data publicly available.
