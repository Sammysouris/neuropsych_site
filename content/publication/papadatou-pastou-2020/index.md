abstract: 'The cerebral lateralization of written language has received very limited
  research attention in comparison to the wealth of studies on the cerebral lateralization
  of oral language. The purpose of the present study was thus to further our understanding
  of written language lateralization, by elucidating on the relative contribution
  of language and motor areas. This was achieved by comparing written word generation
  with a writing task that has similar visuomotor demands, but does not include language
  (i.e., the repeated drawing of symbols). We assessed cerebral laterality in 54 left-
  and right-handed participants by means of functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound
  (fTCD), a non-invasive, perfusion-sensitive neuroimaging technique. Our findings
  suggest that, in right-handers, the linguistic aspect of the written word generation
  task recruited left-hemispheric areas during writing, similarly to oral language
  production. In left-handers, we failed to observe the same effect, possibly due
  to the great variability in cerebral laterality patterns within this group or alternatively
  due to the attentional demands of the symbol copying task. Future work could investigate
  such demands using both simple and complex stimuli in the copying condition.  ###
