abstract: 'Background: Substantial numbers of students in Higher Education (HE) are
  reporting mental health difficulties, such as mild to moderate symptoms of depression
  and anxiety. Coupled with academic skills challenges, these difficulties can lead
  to decreased academic performance, low levels of study satisfaction, and eventually
  drop out. Student support services are facing budget cuts and can only attend to
  limited numbers of students, usually the ones who present with more severe mental
  health problems. Moreover, face-to-face contact may not appeal to those students
  who feel embarrassed by their problems or are afraid of being stigmatised. To address
  this important problem, an online psychological wellbeing and study skills support
  system called MePlusMe, has been developed to provide personalised support to its
  users. In the present study we investigated the feasibility and acceptability of
  the contents, design, and functionalities of the system. Methods: An offline version
  of the system was introduced to 13 postgraduate and undergraduate students (mean
  age = 31.3 years, SD = 10.25 years; 4 males) in a UK HE Institution, who presented
  with mild or moderate mental health difficulties. The participants evaluated the
  design of the system, its functionalities, and contents at Baseline and at Weeks
  2, 4, and 8. Results: Participants found the system easy to use, professional, and
  efficient and its contents non-judgemental and informative. Participants stated
  that engaging with and practicing the techniques targeted at mental health difficulties
  led to improvements in positive thinking and self-confidence, while the study skills
  techniques were practical. Suggestions for further improvement included the development
  of an app and an option for direct engagement with professionals. Conclusions: The
  findings confirmed the acceptability of the contents, design and functionalities
  of the system, while providing useful information to inform its further development.
  Next steps include a feasibility study, which will test and quantify the effects
  on everyday functioning, mood, mental wellbeing, and academic self-efficacy after
  using the system, and subsequently a randomized controlled trial, which will evaluate
  its effectiveness.'
