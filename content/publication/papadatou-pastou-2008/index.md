abstract: Human handedness, a marker for language lateralization in the brain, continues
  to attract great research interest. A widely reported but not universal finding
  is a greater male tendency toward left-handedness. Here the authors present a meta-analysis
  of k = 144 studies, totaling N = 1,787,629 participants, the results of which demonstrate
  that the sex difference is both significant and robust. The overall best estimate
  for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23 (95% confidence interval = 1.19, 1.27).
  The widespread observation of this sex difference is consistent with it being related
  to innate characteristics of sexual differentiation, and its observed magnitude
  places an important constraint on current theories of handedness. In addition, the
  size of the sex difference was significantly moderated by the way in which handedness
  was assessed (by writing hand or by other means), the location of testing, and the
  year of publication of the study, implicating additional influences on its development.
