abstract: Some theories from cognitive psychology and mathematics education suggest
  that children's understanding of mathematical concepts develops together with their
  knowledge of mathematical procedures. However, previous research into children's
  understanding of the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction suggests
  that there are individual differences in the way that this concept develops. To
  determine whether these differences are reliable and reflect alternative paths of
  development, we examined data from 14 studies of children's understanding of inversion.
  Cluster analyses and meta-analytic techniques were used to quantify the size of
  the inversion effect and examine factors influencing its size and to test the stability
  of patterns of individual differences across the studies. Evidence was found for
  reliable patterns of individual differences, which have implications for current
  theories of concept development.
