abstract: By means of an experimental dataset, we use deep learning to implement an
  RGB extrapolation of emotions associated to color, and do a mathematical study of
  the results obtained through this neural network. In particular, we see that males
  (type m individuals) typically associate a given emotion with darker colors while
  females (type f individuals) with brighter colors. A similar trend was observed
  with older people and associations to lighter colors. Moreover, through our classification
  matrix, we identify which colors have weak associations to emotions and which colors
  are typically confused with other colors.
