abstract: "Background: Psychological and study skill difficulties faced by students\
  \ in higher education can lead to poor academic performance, sub-optimal mental\
  \ health, reduced study satisfaction, and drop out from study. At the same time,\
  \ higher education institutions' support services are costly, oversubscribed, and\
  \ struggle to meet demand whilst facing budget reductions. The purpose of the proposed\
  \ study is to evaluate the acceptability of a new online intervention, MePlusMe,\
  \ aimed at students in higher education facing mild to moderate psychological and/or\
  \ study skill difficulties. The study will also assess the feasibility of proposed\
  \ recruitment and outcome assessment protocols for a future trial of effectiveness.\
  \ The system supports self-management strategies alongside ongoing monitoring facilitated\
  \ by a messaging service, as well as featuring a built-in community of student users.\
  \ It is based on current clinical guidelines for the management of common mental\
  \ health problems, together with best practice from the educational field. Methods/design:\
  \ Two hundred and forty two students will be recruited to a within-subjects, repeated\
  \ measures study conducted over 8 weeks. Self-report measures of depression and\
  \ anxiety symptoms, mental wellbeing, academic self-efficacy, and everyday functioning\
  \ will be collected at baseline, and then at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. During this period,\
  \ students will have access to the intervention system. UK higher education institutions\
  \ Bournemouth University and University of Warwick will participate in the study.\
  \ Data on student satisfaction and engagement will also be collected. Study findings\
  \ will help to determine the most appropriate primary outcome and the required sample\
  \ size for a future trial. Discussion: This study will evaluate the acceptability\
  \ of an online intervention system for students facing psychological and/or study\
  \ skill difficulties and will test recruitment procedures and outcome measures for\
  \ a future trial of effectiveness. The system is designed to be implemented as a\
  \ stand-alone service or a service complementary to student support services, which\
  \ is accessible to the majority of students and effective in improving student experience\
  \ at higher education institutions."
