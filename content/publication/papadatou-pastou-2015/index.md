abstract: Understanding the relationship between cerebral laterality and intelligence
  is important in elucidating the neurological underpinnings of individual differences
  in cognitive abilities. A widely used, behavioral indicator for cerebral laterality,
  mainly of language, is handedness. A number of studies have compared cognitive abilities
  between groups of left- and right-handers, while others have investigated the handedness
  prevalence between groups of different cognitive abilities. The present study comprises
  five meta-analyses of studies that have assessed the handedness prevalence in (a)
  individuals with intellectual disability (ID) of unknown/idiopathic nature compared
  to typically developing (TD) individuals, and (b) individuals with intellectual
  giftedness (IG) compared to TD individuals. Nineteen data sets totaling 16,076 participants
  (5795 ID, 8312 TD, and 1969 IG) were included in the analyses. Elevated levels of
  atypical handedness were found to be robust only for the ID to TD comparison. Findings
  constrain the range of acceptable theories on the handedness distribution for different
  intelligence levels.
