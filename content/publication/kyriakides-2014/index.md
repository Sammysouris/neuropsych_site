abstract: A framework based on research on bullying and on educational effectiveness
  was offered to schools to assist them in developing strategies and actions to improve
  their learning environment, their policy for teaching, and their evaluation mechanisms
  in order to reduce bullying. At the beginning and end of the intervention, the Revised
  Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and a teacher questionnaire measuring three school
  factors (school policy for teaching, school learning environment, and school evaluation)
  were administered to the experimental and control groups. This experimental study
  reveals that the intervention had both a direct impact on the reduction of bullying
  and an indirect impact through improving the school factors. Implications for research
  into supporting schools to reduce bullying are given. © 2013 © 2013 Scandinavian
