abstract: Around 90% of humans prefer their right hand for unimanual actions and are
  left-hemisphere dominant for language functions; a pattern far from negligible.
  The phenomena of handedness and cerebral lateralization for language are presented
  along with the different theories that attempt to explain the presence of these
  functional asymmetries. The focus is on the adaptive advantages both on the individual
  and the population level. Most importantly, the intriguing question of why humans
  are right-handed and left-brained and not the other way around is tackled; a number
  of evolutionary, cultural, and genetic accounts are presented, along with theories
  that explain the observed pattern of asymmetries by means of the different properties
  of the two cerebral hemispheres.
