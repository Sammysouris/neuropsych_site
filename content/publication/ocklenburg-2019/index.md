abstract: Predatorâ€“prey relationships have been suggested to be one of the primary
  evolutionary factors driving the development of functional hemispheric asymmetries.
  However, lateralization in many predator species is not well understood and existing
  studies often are statistically underpowered due to small sample sizes and they
  moreover show conflicting results. Here, we statistically integrated findings on
  paw preferences in cats and dogs, two predator species within the Carnivora order
  that are commonly kept as pets in many societies around the globe. For both species,
  there were significantly more lateralized than non-lateralized animals. We found
  that 78% of cats and 68% of dogs showed either left- or right-sided paw preference.
  Unlike humans, neither dogs nor cats showed a rightward paw preference on the population
  level. For cats, but not dogs, we found a significant sex difference, with female
  animals having greater odds of being right-lateralized compared to male animals.
