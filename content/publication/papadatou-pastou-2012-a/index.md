abstract: Antidepressants affect memory and neural responses to emotionally valenced
  stimuli in healthy volunteers. However, it is unclear whether this extends to autobiographical
  memory for personally experienced events. The current study investigated the effects
  of acute administration of the antidepressant reboxetine on emotional autobiographical
  retrieval in healthy volunteers (14 men, 10 women). Functional magnetic resonance
  imaging was used in a double-blind between-groups investigation with reboxetine
  (4 mg) and placebo. Consistent with previous reports using lab-based stimuli, neural
  activation in the processing of positive versus negative memories was reduced following
  reboxetine compared with placebo in the left frontal lobe (extending into the insula)
  and the right superior temporal gyrus. This was paired with increased memory speed
  in volunteers given reboxetine versus placebo. The effect of reboxetine on emotional
  memory extends to recall of personally experienced events. Such effects may be relevant
  to the cognitive improvements found with recovery from depression and with the mechanism
  of action of contemporary antidepressant drugs. Â© 2012 American Psychological Association.
