Dr. Ocklenburg graduated in 2005 from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology.  He earned a Master of Science degree in Psychology 2007 and a Ph.D. in 2011 from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany,  in Natural Sciences. He then worked as postdoc at the Bergen fMRI Group in Norway before his return to Germany. He has been at the Department of Psychology of Ruhr University Bochum since 2013 and was interim professor of biopsychology at the University of Duisburg-Essen during the winter term 2019/2020. His research interests are in the domain of handedness and hemispheric asymmetries. He uses a multimethod approach combining different neuroimaging techniques and electrophysiology with molecular genetic and epigenetic methods. He also has an interest in meta-analysis and other techniques to statistically integrate empirical data. Moreover, he is interested in science communication about left-handedness and hemispheric asymmetries and runs a blog on these topics on Psychology Today.
