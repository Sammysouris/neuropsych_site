Dr. Badcock completed undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the University of Western Australia (UWA). He spent 11 years as a postdoc including time at Oxford University working with Professor Dorothy Bishop and Macquarie University working with Prof. Geneveive McArthur within the Reading Program of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders. In 2020, he returned to UWA as a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychological Science. Dr. Badcock is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist, interested in how perceptual and attentional capacities underpin complex functioning such as how cognitive control relates to reading ability. His research focuses on learning difficulties and exceptional development with the aim of contributing to scientific understanding as well as translation for education and intervention. He conducts these enquiries using behavioural psychophysics and neuroimaging techniques (e.g., electroencephalography, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging).
