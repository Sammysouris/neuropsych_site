The [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) (PSA) is a globally distributed network of psychological science laboratories (currently over 500), representing over 70 countries on all six populated continents, that coordinates data collection for democratically selected studies. Our lab is a member of the PSA, having joined so far studies PSA001, PSA002, PSA002, PSA006 and PSA-COVID19. The PI has also served as an Assistant Director for the Ethics Review Committee.
PSA’s mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, reducing the distance between truth about human behavior and mental processes and our current understanding. This challenge cannot be adequately met by a single researcher or small team. Instead, we attempt to meet this challenge with a distributed laboratory network that is ongoing (as opposed to time or task limited), diverse (both in terms of human subjects and participating researchers), and inclusive (we welcome ideas, contributions, study proposals, or other input from anyone in the field of psychology).
